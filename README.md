Call of Duty Stats Tracker Youâ€™ve been tasked with making an app tracker system for a popular video game Call of Duty. This app displays profiles and statistics over a user. Each user has a profile as well as a weapon. It will be able to calculate KD ratio and win rate.

MVP You should be able to create a Cod Profile with a user, gamer tag, kills, deaths, rank, weapon. You will also have a User with a first name, last name and age. Finally you will also create a Weapon which will have a user, name, type, ammo and range.
There should be a page where you can see all Profiles and be able to click through to each profile to see the details where you should be able to edit or delete the profile and populate with new information.

Extensions: 
Be able to add profiles to the tracker 
Be able to display a KD ratio for a profile 
Be able to set a profile as rank prestige or not
